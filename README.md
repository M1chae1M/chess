Chess game made from scratch in react.
You can play, beat through, promote pions, castling, and even chequer enemy king, but the game at this stage of development so if you lost you must surrender. The orange boxes are the boxes attacked by your figures. If you have same positions 3 times in row it's pat. Same if for 50 moves you do not beat a figure or make a move with a pawn.
