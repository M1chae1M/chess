Chess game made from scratch in react.
You can play, beat through, promote pions, castling, and even chequer enemy king, but the game at this stage of development still allows you to make an illegal move (one after which your king will be chequered) and allows you to defend against checkmate only by beating, or by running away (you cannot you can't cover up after chequered).
The orange boxes are the boxes attacked by your figures.
